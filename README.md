# Projects

This repository contains a collection of my programming projects. 
Each project is a complete, working system built with a focus on correctness, structure, and real-world usability.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Maintain a single, organized place for all my projects
- Demonstrate problem-solving and system design through code
- Show progression across different concepts and technologies
- For tracking number of projects done + languages learnt 
- Each project has its seprate repository

Each project lives in its own folder and includes a dedicated README explaining:
- What the project does
- How it works
- How to build and run it
